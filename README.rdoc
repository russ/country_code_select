== Maintainers Wanted
This project is looking for maintainers. I don't use Ruby primarily anymore and don't interact with this code much.

== Country Code Select

A simple country code select helper. Works exactly the same as country_select but uses country codes instead.

  country_code_select(:user, :country, [[ 'US', 'United States' ], [ 'CA', 'Canada' ]])
